### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my page!

My name is **Julius Yang**. I am currently a Student at University of California, Irvine studying **Computer Engineering**.


My skillset is primarily focused on coding, but I am learning more and more about computer architecture & design! Currently I have experience in: Java, Python, Dart, Assembly, and C.

I want to get into embedded systems and learn how to harness the power of combining hardware and software.

Currently I work part-time at **Starship Technologies** as a **Robot Technician** fixing up robots!
